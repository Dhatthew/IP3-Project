# IP3-Project
This version of the project uses a development tookl known as USBWebserver.
It was used earlier on in the projects development in order to test the show system before and to gain an understanding of what it would be like.
In order to work properly, the user must move the entire IP3 folder into a USB drive and then from inside the drive run USBWebserver.exe.
Once the application is running the user can go to localhost:8080/home.php and start using the system from there.
Php my admin can be accessed by going to http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin/ and entering the username and password(root and usbw, respectively)
This allows for the sever to be run easily from anywhere. For the purposes of documentation, we decided to also include the USBWebserver version of this project.
This version of the project can also allow for a more in depth look at the SQL side of the system if neccessary.
